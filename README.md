# python-challenge
This was a really fun challenge! I scratched my head a bit, but have completed both projects completely with comments.

**Glossary** of variables:

**PyBank**
totalpl = total Profit/Loss across all months
prevPL = previous month's profit/loss reported

**PyPoll:**
tVoteCount = Total Vote Count
cCandidate = Current Candidate
candidatevotes = list of candidates

The rest should be rather self explainatory.

I have opted not to upload the reference CSV files. I do apologise if this has caused any inconvinience on the grader's end. Please leave a comment if you would like me to include resource files in future :)
